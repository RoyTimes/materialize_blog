# About

The webpage is completely builded with React.js & React Router! React Rocks! Well.. Something about myself. I am from China, apparently. I am a senior high school student. It's like always be my kinda aim to create my own blog system specially for myself to host blogs. This blog use Material-UI by [@callthemall](https://github.com/callemall) team and [React.js](https://reactjs.com) crafted by Facebook! All the posts are dynamicly loaded by Ajax from Github server. My original Markdown version of all my posts would be temporarily store in my [markdown repo](http://github.com/RoyTimes/markdown) Later, when I completely wrap up all the works I would definitely Open Source all the JSX code from which the webpage compiled. My detailed Tech Stack & Contact Info is below the Chinese version of "About"

特别开心终于这个工程要完成了，终于实现了人生目标之一 -- 自己写一套自己的博客系统! 现在博客采用React.js & React Route 利用webpack编译而成。核心Post.json数据库以后考虑动态生成，现在还是手写的阶段，其次以后也会用自己的API server去做文档内容的Host. 大概就这样 ＝＝ 反正写中文就是代表i am from China. 基本看我博客的人上面的也差不多没啥看不懂的。23333 以后评论系统啊一类的慢慢加，API server功能也在慢慢构建。工程完成80%.
